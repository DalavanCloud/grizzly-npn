    <description>
        This empty module allows the bootclasspath classes in org.glassfish.grizzly.npn
        to be available via the OSGi classloading mechanisms.

        Using GlassFish as an example:
          - grizzly-npn-bootstrap.jar goes into the domain's bootclasspath (-Xbootclasspath/p:[PATH TO THE JAR])
          - grizzly-npn-osgi and grizzly-spdy JARs go into the $GF_HOME/modules directory.
